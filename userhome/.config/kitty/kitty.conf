mouse_map shift+left      click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_click_url_or_select
mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_click_url

#: Variant with ctrl+shift is present because the simple click based
#: version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to disambiguate
#: clicks from double clicks.

mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

#: Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
#: grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
#: open a URL.

repaint_delay 12

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be
#: processed, repaint_delay is ignored.

input_delay 5

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

enable_audio_bell yes

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.05

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

remember_window_size  yes
initial_window_width  640
initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

enabled_layouts *

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing windows. The cells value is used for horizontal resizing
#: and the lines value for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 0.5pt

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified the unit is assumed to
#: be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders yes

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: minimum needed borders for inactive windows are drawn. That is only
#: the borders that separate the inactive window from a neighbor. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window margin overrides this and causes all
#: borders to be drawn.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin (in pts) to use when only a single window is
#: visible. Negative values will cause the value of
#: window_margin_width to be used instead. A single value sets all
#: four sides. Two values set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three
#: values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right,
#: bottom and left.

window_padding_width 0

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be on
#: only the bottom and right edges.

active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows

bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred

inactive_text_alpha 1.0

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this setting when reloading config are undefined.

resize_debounce_time 0.1

#: Choose how kitty draws a window while a resize is in progress. A
#: value of static means draw the current window contents, mostly
#: unchanged. A value of scale means draw the current window contents
#: scaled. A value of blank means draw a blank window. A value of size
#: means show the window size in cells.

resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with an
#: initial_window_width and initial_window_height in number of cells,
#: this option can be used to keep the margins as small as possible
#: when resizing the OS window. Note that this does not currently work
#: on Wayland.

confirm_os_window_close 0

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab that has at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it. A value of zero disables
#: confirmation. This confirmation also applies to requests to quit
#: the entire application (all OS windows, via the quit action).

tab_bar_edge top

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

tab_bar_margin_width 0.0

#: The margin to the left and right of the tab bar (in pts)

tab_bar_margin_height 0.0 0.0

#: The margin above and below the tab bar (in pts). The first number
#: is the margin between the edge of the OS Window and the tab bar and
#: the second number is the margin between the tab bar and the
#: contents of the current tab.

tab_bar_style powerline
#: The tab bar style, can be one of:

#: fade
#:     Each tab's edges fade into the background color (see tab_fade)
#: slant
#:     Tabs look like the tabs in a physical file
#: separator
#:     Tabs are separated by a configurable separator (see tab_separator)
#: powerline
#:     Tabs are shown as a continuous line with "fancy" separators (see tab_powerline_style)
#: hidden
#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create a mapping
#:     for the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/#select-tab action which presents you with a list
#:     of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown

tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

tab_powerline_style round

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, or round.

tab_activity_symbol none

#: Some text or a unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces surround the text with quotes.

tab_title_template "{title}"

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title. If you wish to include the tab-index as well, use something
#: like: {index}: {title}. Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for
#: goto_tab N. If you prefer to see the index as a superscript, use
#: {sup.index}. In addition you can use {layout_name} for the current
#: layout name, {num_windows} for the number of windows in the tab and
#: {num_window_groups} for the number of window groups (not counting
#: overlay windows) in the tab. Note that formatting is done by
#: Python's string formatting machinery, so you can use, for instance,
#: {layout_name[:2].upper()} to show only the first two letters of the
#: layout name, upper-cased. If you want to style the text, you can
#: use styling directives, for example:
#: {fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.default}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}green
#: bg{fmt.bg.normal}. Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: {fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}.

active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs, if not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

#: background color.

foreground #DFDEF1
background #1E1E2E

background_opacity 0.85

dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

selection_foreground #1E1E2E

#: The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none
#: means to leave the color unchanged.

allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.


update_check_interval 0

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#startup-sessions in the
#: kitty documentation for details. Note that relative paths are
#: interpreted with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment
#: variables in the path are expanded. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary. The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase unicode characters.
#: For example: ``a`` for the A key, ``[`` for the left square bracket
#: key, etc. For functional keys, such as ``Enter or Escape`` the
#: names are present at https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-
#: protocol/#functional-key-definitions. For a list of modifier names,
#: see: GLFW mods <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option.
#: Then kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that
#: text look for ``native_code`` the value of that becomes the key
#: name in the shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 65 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: 0x0 text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map ctrl+a to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here </actions>.

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

clear_all_shortcuts no

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: You can create aliases for kitten names, this allows overriding the
#: defaults for kitten options and can also be used to shorten
#: repeated mappings of the same kitten with a specific group of
#: options. For example, the above alias changes the default value of
#: kitty +kitten hints --hints-offset to zero for all mappings,
#: including the builtin ones.

#: Clipboard {{{

map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#: There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#: mapped to Ctrl+c. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#: send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly, copy_and_clear_or_interrupt
#: will copy and clear the selection or send an interrupt if there is
#: no selection.

map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
map kitty_mod+s paste_from_selection
map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#: will be passed as a command line argument to the program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: Window management {{{

map kitty_mod+enter new_window

#: You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+y      launch mutt

#: You can open a new window with the current working directory set to
#: the working directory of the current window using::

#:     map ctrl+alt+enter    launch --cwd=current

#: You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via the
#: kitty remote control facility by prefixing the command line with @.
#: Any programs running in that window will be allowed to control
#: kitty. For example::

#:     map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

#: You can open a new window next to the currently active window or as

#:     map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor some_program
#:     map ctrl+f launch --location=first some_program

#: For more details, see launch.

map kitty_mod+n new_os_window

#: Open the kitty shell in a new window/tab/overlay/os_window to
#: control kitty using commands.

map kitty_mod+a>m    set_background_opacity +0.1
map kitty_mod+a>l    set_background_opacity -0.1
map kitty_mod+a>1    set_background_opacity 1
map kitty_mod+a>d    set_background_opacity default
map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active

#: You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For example::

#:     # Reset the terminal
#:     map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#:     # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#:     map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#:     # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#:     map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active
#:     # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#:     map kitty_mod+f12 clear_terminal scroll active

#: If you want to operate on all windows instead of just the current
#: one, use all instead of active.

#: It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#: screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#: instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#: following to ~/.zshrc:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#:         printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#:         zle clear-screen
#:     }
#:     zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#:     bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file

#: Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it was
#: loaded. Note that a handful of settings cannot be dynamically
#: changed and require a full restart of kitty.  You can also map a
#: keybinding to load a different config file, for example::

#:     map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#: Note that all setting from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#: in other words the new conf settings *replace* the old ones.

map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config

#: Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running with
#: and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.


#: You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#: client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#: This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#: combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so you
#: can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send
#: unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode characters
#: directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to send_text is the
#: keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
#: values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated
#: combination of them.  The special keyword all means all modes. The
#: modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#: for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty extended
#: keyboard protocol.

#: Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#: the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
