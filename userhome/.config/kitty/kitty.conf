input_delay 5

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

enable_audio_bell yes

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

visual_bell_duration 0.05

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this setting when reloading config are undefined.

confirm_os_window_close 0

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab that has at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it. A value of zero disables
#: confirmation. This confirmation also applies to requests to quit
#: the entire application (all OS windows, via the quit action).
